# AdditionChallenge
 Small game to teach addition to children (works in Editor)
I created this as a test to develop a small game in 2-3 days. It is meant to be a proof of concept so the code isn't too optimized.
I used a queue to  keep track of the additions. An array would have served as well considering the small data volume, but the queue is more straightforward.
As additional functionality I added visual feedback for 3-answer streaks and increased difficulty after a customizable number of correct answers.
Using gravity and 2D physics for the falling additons worked as quick alternative approach, but I'd prefer a more traditional speed-based movement for an actual product.
